          <h1> Syracuse Police Department and Citizen Review Board Show Minimal Response to Filed Complaints</h1>
               <h2> BY ZAARA MALIK </h2>
              <p> Both organizations have struggled to keep up with hundreds of filed complaints against police misconduct, but many of the cases are not being addressed in time for any feasible change to be made.</p>

 </p>

                 <p> The Citizens Review Board and Syracuse Police Department has received up to 149 cases regarding police misconduct over the last few years. Many of these complaints have led to little to no consequences or insufficient changes to police behavior. New York state only gives officer complaints a year and a half to be investigated before it expires. Recently, in a quarterly review report <a href="https://www.syr.gov/files/sharedassets/public/v/1/1-boards-and-commissions/crb/documents/quarterly-reports/2025/quarterly-report-3rd-quarter-july-1-september-30.pdf"> the CRB </a>mentioned how up to 57 cases have been expired and have missed being reviewed by the board. 

                
                  </p>The lack of attention to police misconduct complaints is a growing issue throughout the state and this issue remains prevalent in Syracuse as well. Organizations such as the CRB have created a police officer complaint form, an additional resource for people to file misconduct cases that is independent of the SPD. </p> 
               

                  <p> But over the past four years, many complaints have yet to be  addressed, with only 42 cases being closed as of June of this year according to data by Open Data Syracuse. Many filed complaints have written excessive force or false arrest as the allegation which creates questions of how issues such as police misconduct are being properly addressed in a manner that reduces repeat incidents. </p>


                  <p> David Barrington-Ward is the Director of Communications at the National Police Accountability Project and explained how oftentimes, working through organizations such as the Citizens Review Board can be the biggest hurdle for those trying to file a complaint. 
 </p>
             

                 <p> “The system and the way that it is currently structured is very preferential to police officers and not necessarily preferential to the public who may have complaints about officer conduct or their experience with those officers” Ward said. 

                 Ward also explained how these systems along with a lack of accessibility have caused many cases to go unheard. He continued to emphasize how many people who file complaints are not aware of essential information such as the expiration timeline for a complaint to be investigated. 
                                                                            </p>

                      <p> Ward also explained how these systems along with a lack of accessibility has caused many cases to go unheard. He continued to emphasize how many people who file complaints are not aware of essential information such as the expiration timeline for a complaint to be investigated. </p>



                <p>This issue of a lack of accessibility creates a discrepancy around how accurate data may be since there is a possibility of police misconduct occurring but going unnoticed due to a lack of understanding of the system.</p>


                <p>After analyzing the data it was found that when consequences did occur to officers, the allegation that led to disciplinary action most commonly was failure to act, but out of 41 reported complaints about failure to act, only 10 officers were given disciplinary action. In terms of non-disciplinary action taken against those under the same allegation, only one case resulted in a non-disciplinary consequence. This means only 24% of cases that were filed under failure to act have resulted in any consequences overall for SPD officers, and leaves 11 cases without any current results.

                                   </p>

                <p>Since 2021 there have been 27 complaints that have been made over an excessive use of force. Ward emphasized how this amount for a police force of 400 officers should be a reason for concern for community members. 
                                                                                     </p>  

               <p>“It’s an opportunity for the community to engage those entities more meaningfully and to get to the bottom of why these complaints are taking place and what the agency is planning to remedy those complaints and ensure that there's a policy in place that prevents future complaints against those officers or future officers”  Ward said. </p>

               <p> Out of the total number of cases recorded in the data, only 42 cases have been investigated and closed which leaves up to 107 cases yet to be analyzed. This means 29% of cases from the last update in June are still in process or are awaiting to be processed. </p>


               <p> The lack of results that occur after filing complaints can often be unsatisfactory for victims especially as they are forced to navigate a complicated legal process to file the right information at the right time and how these results impact victims. 

             <p> The overall consensus found in talks with Ward was how the lack of accountability of officers in Syracuse is an issue that goes deeper than the surface due to the fact that many complaints often don’t go through properly due to a lack of legal resources. As a result of this, the National Police Accountability Project is releasing a tool to be implemented in police departments in order for people to know exactly how to properly file complaints in their district. </p>

             <p>Through the Professional Office of Standards and Training and Post Certification Agencies, people will be able to use these tools to file a complaint instead of relying on Citizen Review Board’s or police agencies. These entities will also create another group responsible to keep a watch on officer behavior and help maintain accountability. </p>

             <p>“This will give people another avenue to be able to file complaints because often people are filing complaints at the local level, either through Citizen Review Boards or through Internal Affairs or some sort of equivalent entity. Whereas the POST entity is the entity that certifies whether an officer is actually able to be certified to work at that department or any other department in the future” Ward added. </p>
